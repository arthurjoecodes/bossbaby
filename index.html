Boss Baby stays intelligent by drinking a "Secret Baby Formula" that enables a baby to act like an adult; however, should a baby not drink it after a period of time, he or she becomes a regular baby. When they overhear Boss Baby's boss threatening to fire him for not bringing in information, which would strip him of his formula and strand him at the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to prevent that.
Tim's parents "un-ground" him and take them to Puppy Co. for take your child to work day. While there, they slip away and find what they think is the plans for a "Forever Puppy", but they are captured by the company's founder and CEO, Francis E. Francis.

 His return to baby state is complete while on the rocket, and begins to cry, but Tim sings to him with the family song to show his appreciation, causing him to jump off the rocket before it launches. After the rocket does launch, Tim takes Boss Baby to the formula vat and he returns to his original self. Francis then emerges from the vat, having been reverted to an obese baby and tries to attack Boss Baby, but is picked up by a redeemed Eugene and tells Tim and Boss Baby that "This time, we'll raise him right".
Boss Baby is promoted and leaves while the parents have their memory erased of him so they won’t become suspicious. Tim goes back to being an only child, but he and Boss Baby, having bonded with each other during their mission, begin to miss each other.
